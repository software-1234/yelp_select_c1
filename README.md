# Yelp Chooser
This is a restaurant selector based on a user's preferences for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. 

I have never done any sort of web development before so this was certainly an undertaking. I decided on the questions I did for the questionnaire because I felt that those were the most important things while not wanting to overwhelm the user. Overall, this was a great experience being able to learn these new technologies and deploy a web app for the first time. 

I used Python for the app utilizing Flask and Jinja, with Materialize for the CSS framework.
